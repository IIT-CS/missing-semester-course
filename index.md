# The "Missing" Semester

This webpage curates resources for students to familiarize themselves with skills and tools that are used in many courses and in the industry. This endeavor is inspired (and largely) relies on MIT's missing semester course [https://missing.csail.mit.edu/](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

Note that some courses expect you to have worked through particular sections. Instructors will let you know what their expectations are.
